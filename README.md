# <font color="#00b0f0">ðŸš¢ Battleship</font>

Basic implementation of the popular game [Battleship](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Battleship_(game)) on CLI, running on Python. The player plays against the machine.


## Notes

- Unlike in the game's standard rules, in this implementation, ships may be placed in contiguous squares.
- Ships are not placed on the board by players, they're placed at random.

## Requirements 

- Python 3.10+
- A terminal emulator that displays emoji: e.g., Windows Terminal, Konsole,...

### Libraries
 - [NumPy](https://github.com/numpy/numpy)


## Difficulty levels

- **Easy** difficulty lets CPU give repeat guesses. 
- **Hard** difficulty avoids repeat guesses by the machine.

## Key
ðŸŒŠ  Empty or unexplored sea

ðŸš¢  A standing ship (or part of one)

ðŸ’¥  A struck ship (or part of one)

âœ…  A previously struck position
